#### What's Seraphic You Ask?
Inspired by the essence of 'seraphic,' as defined by Oxford, *encapsulating beauty and purity akin to an angel*, I embarked on transforming my system. Opting for the Everblush colorscheme, I aimed for minimalism without compromising on vibrancy. Despite my affinity for dark themes, I yearned for an explosion of colors - blooming and bright. This desire led me down the path of cuteness. Instead of adhering strictly to a colorscheme, I embraced the idea of a theme. Choosing 'cuteness' injected a sense of fun and creativity into the process, steering away from the mundane task of adhering to a predefined color palette. It's not just about the colors; it's about evoking a feeling, an ambiance - one that's as enchanting as it is delightful.

I hope you liked this rice and it gave you inspiration to do something of your own <3, if so, don't forget to star this repo! 
Thanks!

 ## 🌈 How to Setup?
put config files where they are supposed to, twist your fingers and hope everything will work fine! Just kidding XD. Install Fonts first, then programs, copy the dotfiles, setup the dotfiles as per the application, if you face further errors, google 'em or raise an issue!
Thanks! 
Here are some points to take into consideration while combing though these:
1. The Rofi Menu is launched by script in `rofi/launchers/type-3/launcher.sh` , customize it by modifying `style-3.rasi` in the same folder
2. Rofi PowerMenu is launched by script in `rofi/powermenu/type-4/powermenu.sh`, customize it by modifying `style-5.rasi`  in the same folder
3. Spicetify has a Custom Theme that's in `spicetify/Themes/customTheme/` change your config-xpui.ini so.
4. Thank you for looking into this dotfiles, it means a lot to me ;) don't forget to star if you liked my work.
